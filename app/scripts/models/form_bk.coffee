    # Default FieldDB Datum

    # `@defaultFieldDBDatum` returns an object representing a default FieldDB
    # Datum (i.e., form). Note that most of the "meat" is in `datumFields`,
    # an array of objects.

    # The structure of each of these datum field object is as follows, where
    # the `label` and `value` are, in general, most important:

    #   defaultfield:        <boolean> (presumably indicates whether this is a
    #                                   "default" field or a "non-standard" one
    #                                   that a user has chosen to use)
    #   encryptedValue:      <string>  (= `value` unless encrypted, I think)
    #   fieldDBtype:         <string>  ("DatumField" is the standard value, I
    #                                   would think)
    #   help:                <string>  (help text, e.g., for an HTML title
    #                                   attribute)
    #   id:                  <string>  (usually equals `label`; I don't
    #                                   understand the difference; must be
    #                                   unique?)
    #   label:               <string>  (what kind of field this is, e.g.,
    #                                   `"utterance"`)
    #   labelFieldLinguists: <string>  (label for field linguists)
    #   mask:                <string>  (usually = `value` but when encrypted I
    #                                   think this is a more user-friendly
    #                                   hidden representation, e.g., "XXX-XX")
    #   shouldBeEncrypted:   <boolean> (whether the value should be encrypted)
    #   size:                <string>  (stringified integer; indicates the max
    #                                   length of the possible values?...)
    #   value:               <string>  (the value in the field; are values
    #                                   other than strings permitted?)
    #   version:             <string>  (the version of the client app (e.g.,
    #                                   Spreadsheet) or the FieldDB server? A
    #                                   string like "v2.38.16")

    # Note, however, that a `datumField` object can also have other attributes.
    # For example, the datum field with label `modifiedByUser` can have a `user`
    # attribute whose value is an object.

    # In fact, it's more complicated since some `datumField` objects have a very
    # different set of attributes. The datum fields of the ETI 3 Data Tutorial
    # corpus, for instance, has "label", "value", "mask", "encrypted",
    # "shouldBeEncrypted", "help", "showToUserTypes", and "userchooseable".

    # The labels of the default datum field objects are:

    #   judgement:          <string> (equivalent to OLD's `grammaticality`; oddly
    #                                 `grammatical` is sometimes a value here;
    #                                 "Grammaticality/acceptability judgement
    #                                 (*,#,?, etc). Leaving it blank can mean
    #                                 grammatical/acceptable, or you can choose a

    #                                 can tell)

    # field label or by matching the "attribute" to a true attribute of the
    # datum.

    # OLD Schema
    ############################################################################

    # `@defaultOLDForm` returns a default OLD form. For details on this schema,
    # see
    # - https://github.com/jrwdunham/old/blob/master/onlinelinguisticdatabase/model/form.py

    # - https://github.com/jrwdunham/old/blob/master/onlinelinguisticdatabase/lib/schemata.py#L289-L316

    # Note that the OLD *emits* relational attributes as JSON objects but it
    # *accepts* them *only* as integer ids. That is, a GET request for a form
    # will return an object whose `enterer` value is an object, e.g.,
    #
    #   "enterer": {"id": 37, "first_name": "Joel", ...},
    #
    # but PUT and POST requests to update/add a form *must* valuate their
    # relational attributes as integer ids only, e.g.,
    #
    #   "enterer": 1,

    # Note that some attributes are commented-out below. This is because these
    # attributes are valuated server-side and should not have client-side
    # defaults. That is, the OLD will send them to us, but we cannot directly
    # modify them on the server with a PUT/POST request. Nevertheless, it is
    # useful to describe their properties here.

    # For a complete list of the attributes that can be specified when
    # creating/updating an OLD form, see

    # FieldDb to Dative: input: a FieldDB datum object, output: a Dative form model
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    fieldDB2dative: (fieldDBDatum) ->
      # A FieldDB Datum is, at its core, an array of objects, each of which has
      # a `label` and a `value` attribute. This method essentially creates a new
      # object from that label/value information. Certain labels are changed.
      # The entire fieldDBDatum is stored in the newly created Dative model under
      # the attribute `fieldDBDatum` so that other # attributes (i.e., `mask`,
      # `encrypted`, `shouldBeEncrypted`, `help`, `size`, and
      # `userchooseable` can be recovered).

      @set 'id', fieldDBDatum.id
      @set fieldDBDatum.value

    # Converts attribute names and values, as appropriate. Also stores the
    # FieldDB datum object unmodified in an attribute.
    #
    # TODO:
    #
    # - dative2fieldDB
    # - old2dative
    # - dative2old
    #
    # TODO: answer these questions (w/ help from @cesine):

    # 1. datumField.tags is simply a string. Do the current FieldDB
    # applications make any assumptions about how tags are identified within
    # that string? I am assuming that it's just a string and the exectation
    # is that users will use whatever tag-delimiting conventions they like.
    # In the OLD, a tag can have a name that has whitespace in it. An OLD tag
    # is an object with `name`, `id`, and `description` attributes. Do we want
    # to modify the FieldDB data structure to allow for these types of tags?
    # For now I am renaming FieldDB tags as `fieldDBTags` on Dative and I will
    # treat FieldDB and OLD tags differently.

    # 2. What to do with `datumField.validationStatus`? Is it the equivalent of
    # the OLD's `status`? Since both are strings, I am (for now) treating them
    # both as `status` fields in Dative.

    # 3. What to do with `datumStates`? It is an array of objects with 4
    # attributes: `color`, `showInSearchResults`, `selected`, and `state`. I am
    # currently not using this attribute in Dative.

    # 4. `datumField.syntacticCategory` is actually a segmented list of
    # categories corresponding to each morpheme in the morphemeBreak, at
    # least that is what I glean it should be from the `help` value for this
    # field. In my opinion, this field is misnamed, as is "gloss". Both
    # should be plural: "syntacticCategories" and "glosses" since they are
    # really sequences of categories and glosses. Consequently,
    # "syntacticCategory" should be given to the category of the entire
    # datum/form, as in the OLD. I am renaming both
    # `FieldDB.Datum.syntacticCategory` and
    # `OLD.Form.syntacticCategoryString` to `Dative.Form.syntacticCategories`.
    # `OLD.Form.syntacticCategory` is `Dative.Form.syntacticCategory` and
    # there is, as of yet, no equivalent in FieldDB.

    # 5. `datumField.syntacticTreeLaTeX`. I'm just leaving this as is for now.
    # The OLD assumes (implicitly) that the values of its `syntax` attributes
    # will be PTB-style bracket notation trees. Dative should be able to do
    # stuff with both. My current approach is for Dative to rename
    # `OLD.Form.syntax` to `Dative.Form.syntacticTreePTB` and to adopt
    # `FieldDB.datumField.syntacticTreeLaTeX` as
    # `Dative.Form.syntacticTreeLaTeX`. That is, the two syntax bracket
    # notation fields will co-exist, for now. (Even though you can easily get
    # from PTB trees to QTree/LaTeX ones as I do in the OLD web app ...)

    # 6. `datumField.`modifiedByUser` is an array of all users who have modified
    # the form. This is odd because it's useful to know the order of who modified
    # it. The OLD stores all of this information: who made what modification when.
    # (In the OLD, `modifier` is an object representing the user to make the last
    # modification. Previous modifiers can be retrieved by retrieving the history
    # of a form.) Is the `modifiedByUser` array ordered? Is there a way to
    # recover the modification history from the corpus service so that we can
    # provide a "get history" feature? For now I am having Dative use both
    # FieldDB's `modifiedByUser` and the OLD's `modifier` and Dative will treat
    # them differently.

    # 7. What is the difference between `datumTags` and `datumFields.tags`?
    # Looks to me like the latter isn't being used by the Spreadsheet app: it
    # uses the former. I am taking FieldDB `tags` as `fieldDBTags` and
    # FieldDB `datumTags` as `fieldDBDatumTags`. OLD `tags` will be `tags`,
    # for now...

    # 8. `comments` is an array. I think that the OLD and FieldDB are using the
    # word "comments" in two different ways. In the OLD, "comments" is just a
    # string of comments by the creator/editor of the form about the form. In
    # FieldDB, "comments" is an array of comments made by various users about
    # the form. Thus a user might only have the "Commenter" role on a corpus
    # and may be allowed to add comments but not do much else. For now I am
    # renaming `FieldDB.Datum.comments` to `Dative.Form.fieldDBComments`.

    # 9. I am renaming FieldDB `utterance` to Dative `transcription`. In the
    # OLD, `transcription` is by default and implicitly an orthographic
    # transcription. However, `Orthography` is another field option in some
    # FieldDB GUIs. The OLD has specific `phoneticTranscription` and
    # `narrowPhoneticTranscription` fields. Not clear to me just yet how we
    # should deal with these various similar fields. The logic around all of
    # these fields should be the same/ similar, i.e., in terms of IGT
    # formatting.
