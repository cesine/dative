  # Languages View
  # --------------
  #
  # Displays a collection of languages for browsing, with pagination. Also
  # contains a model-less `LanguageView` instance for creating new languages
  # within the browse interface.
  #
  # Note: the languages resource is read-only. It's just the ISO 639-3
  # Ethnologue language data and is a convenience.
  #
  # Note: most functionality is coded in the `ResourcesView` base class.
