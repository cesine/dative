  # HTML Snippet Representation View
  # --------------------------------
  #
  # A view for the representation of an HTML snippet, e.g., the HTML generated
  # from the `page_content` value of a user.
  #
  # What's special about this is that OLD-specific references in the text need
  # to be interpreted and transformed into links or embedded images:
  #
  # - `form(<id>)(<text>)` is transformed into a link with text `<text>` that
  #    brings up the form with `id=<id>` in a dialog.
  # - `file(<id>)(<text>)` is the same as the above, but with files.
  # - `file[<id>]` embeds the content of the file with `id=<id>` in the HTML.

      'click .link-to-resource': 'signalInabilityToLink'

    # In the "circular" subclass, this maps the name of a resource, e.g.,
    # 'form', to a tuple containing both a view and a model class for that
    # resource.
